## What is a JSO-compliant solver

A JSO-compliant solver is a solver whose
- input is a model implementing the NLPModels API; and
- output is a specific struct from the package SolverCore.

That means that you can devise your solver based on a single API that will work with many different problems.
Furthermore, since the output type is known, we can provide tools to compare different solvers.

To illustrate the procedure for creating a solver with the JSO API, we'll implement a Line-Search Modified Newton solver for the problem

$$ \min_x \ f(x) $$

## Method description

The method consists of following the direction $d_k$ that solves

$$ \nabla^2 f(x_k) d_k = -\nabla f(x_k) $$

This is only reasonable if the system can be solved and $d_k$ is a descent direction.
A sufficient condition for that is that $\nabla^2 f(x_k)$ is positive definite, which is equivalent to saying that it has a Cholesky decomposition.

Since this will not be true in general, the modified Newton method consists of computing $\rho_k \geq 0$ such that $\nabla^2 f(x_k) + \rho_k I$ is positive definite.
One way to find such a $\rho_k$ is given below

```
1. Start with ρ from the last iteration
2. Try to compute the Cholesky factor of ∇²f(x) + ρI
3. If not successful, increase ρ to either 1e-8 or 10ρ, whichever is largest, and return to step 2
4. Otherwise, continue the algorithm
```

Next, for the line-search part, we use backtracking and ask that the Armijo condition be satisfied, that is find the smallest $p \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $t = σ^p$ satisfies

$$ f(x_k + td_k) < f(x_k) + \alpha t g_k^T d_k, $$

for $\alpha  \in (0,1)$, called the Armijo parameter.

## Defining a test problem with ADNLPModels and accessing its functions with the NLPModels API

Let's define a test problem to verify that our method is working, and let's use a classic one: Rosenbrock's function[^1]

$$ \min_x \ (x_1 - 1)^2 + 4 (x_2 - x_1^2)^2, $$

starting from point [-1.2; 1.0].

```julia:ex1
using Plots
gr(size=(600,300))
contour(-2:0.02:2, -0.5:0.02:1.5, (x,y) -> (x - 1)^2 + 4 * (y - x^2)^2, levels=(0:0.2:10).^2)
png(joinpath(@OUTPUT, "prob1")) # hide
```

\figalt{Contour plot of objective}{prob1.png}

Notice that the solution of the problem, i.e., the point at which the function is minimum, is $x = (1,1)^T$.
This can be estimated by the plot and verified by noticing that $f(1,1) = 0$ and $f(x) > 0$ for any other point.

To write this problem as a NLPModel, we have a few options, but for now let's consider the simplest one: ADNLPModels.
ADNLPModels has a simple interface and it computes the derivatives using automatic differentiation from other packages.

```julia:ex2
using ADNLPModels

nlp = ADNLPModel(
  x -> (x[1] - 1)^2 + 4 * (x[2] - x[1]^2)^2, # function
  [-1.2; 1.0] # starting point
)
```

Now we access the information of the model, and its functions.
The information is all stored on `nlp.meta`, while the functions are defined by NLPModels.

The main information you may want is summarised below

```julia:ex3
(
  nlp.meta.nvar, # number of variable
  nlp.meta.ncon, # number of constraints
  nlp.meta.lvar, nlp.meta.uvar, # bounds on variables
  nlp.meta.lcon, nlp.meta.ucon, # bounds on constraints
  nlp.meta.x0 # starting point
)
```

Furthermore, you can use some functions from NLPModels to query whether the problem has bounds, equalities, inequalities, etc.

```julia:ex4
using NLPModels

unconstrained(nlp)
```

Finally, we can access the objective function, its gradients and Hessian with

```julia:ex5
x = nlp.meta.x0
obj(nlp, x)
```

```julia:ex6
grad(nlp, x)
```

```julia:ex7
hess(nlp, x)
```

For our basic unconstrained solver that's enough. If you want more functions, check the [NLPModels reference guide](/pages/references/NLPModels/).

Notice that the Hessian returned from `hess` has only the lower triangle.
That's done, in general, to avoid storing repeated elements. In this dense case, this isn't much helpful, so we can simply use `Symmetric` to fill the rest.

```julia:ex8
using LinearAlgebra

Symmetric(hess(nlp, x), :L)
```

To compute Cholesky and verify that it succeeds, we use `cholesky` and `issuccess`.

```julia:ex9
B = Symmetric(hess(nlp, x), :L)
factor = cholesky(B, check=false) # check is false to prevent an error from being thrown.
issuccess(factor)
```

```julia:ex10
B = -Symmetric(hess(nlp, x), :L) # Since the last one is positive definite, this one shouldn't be
factor = cholesky(B, check=false)
issuccess(factor)
```

Therefore the direction computation can be done as

```julia:ex11
ρ = 0.0 # First iteration

B = Symmetric(hess(nlp, x), :L)
factor = cholesky(B + ρ * I, check=false)
while !issuccess(factor)
  ρ = max(1e-8, 10ρ)
  factor = cholesky(B + ρ * I, check=false)
end
d = factor \ -grad(nlp, x)
```

The second part of our method is the step length computation.
Let's use `α = 1e-2` for our Armijo parameter.

```julia:ex12
α = 1e-2
t = 1.0
fx = obj(nlp, x)
ft = obj(nlp, x + t * d)
slope = dot(grad(nlp, x), d)
while !(ft ≤ fx + t * slope)
  global t *= 0.5 # global is used because we are outside a function
  ft = obj(nlp, x + t * d)
end
```

The two snippets above are what define our method.
We'll use the first order criteria for stopping the algorithm, that is

$$ \| \nabla f(x_k) \| < \epsilon $$

```julia:ex13
using SolverCore

function newton(nlp :: AbstractNLPModel)

  x = copy(nlp.meta.x0) # starting point
  α = 1e-2 # Armijo parameter
  ρ = 0.0

  while norm(grad(nlp, x)) > 1e-6

    # Computing the direction
    B = Symmetric(hess(nlp, x), :L)
    factor = cholesky(B + ρ * I, check=false)
    while !issuccess(factor)
      ρ = max(1e-8, 10ρ)
      factor = cholesky(B + ρ * I, check=false)
    end
    d = factor \ -grad(nlp, x)

    # Computing the step length
    t = 1.0
    fx = obj(nlp, x)
    ft = obj(nlp, x + t * d)
    slope = dot(grad(nlp, x), d)
    while !(ft ≤ fx + α * t * slope)
      t *= 0.5
      ft = obj(nlp, x + t * d)
    end

    x += t * d
  end

  status = :first_order

  return GenericExecutionStats(status, nlp)

end
```

Notice the two conditions for the method to be JSO-compliant:

- Input is a NLPModel - Namely, an `AbstractNLPModel`:
```
function newton(nlp :: AbstractNLPModel)
```
- output is a specific struct from the package SolverCore - Namely, a `GenericExecutionStats`:
```
return GenericExecutionStats(status, nlp)
```
For this structure to be used, a `status` argument needs to be passed, indicating what's the situation of the solver run.
We passed a `:first_order` value, indicating that a first order solution was found.
More about this later.

The NLPModels API provides you with the derivatives, and anything else can reside inside the function, and there is where the magic happens.

Let's run our implementation on the problem we defined before.

```julia:ex14
output = newton(nlp)

println(output)
```

The `GenericExecutionStats` structure holds all relevant information. Notice, however, that it doesn't have anything useful in this case.
Naturally, we have to return that information as well.

Update your `newton` function so that the end is something like the following.

```julia:ex15
function newton(nlp :: AbstractNLPModel)
  # …
  x = copy(nlp.meta.x0) # starting point # hide
  α = 1e-2 # Armijo parameter # hide
  ρ = 0.0 # hide
  while norm(grad(nlp, x)) > 1e-6 # hide
    B = Symmetric(hess(nlp, x), :L) # hide
    factor = cholesky(B + ρ * I, check=false) # hide
    while !issuccess(factor) # hide
      ρ = max(1e-8, 10ρ) # hide
      factor = cholesky(B + ρ * I, check=false) # hide
    end # hide
    d = factor \ -grad(nlp, x) # hide
    t = 1.0 # hide
    fx = obj(nlp, x) # hide
    ft = obj(nlp, x + t * d) # hide
    slope = dot(grad(nlp, x), d) # hide
    while !(ft ≤ fx + α * t * slope) # hide
      t *= 0.5 # hide
      ft = obj(nlp, x + t * d) # hide
    end # hide
    x += t * d # hide
  end # hide
  status = :first_order # hide

  return GenericExecutionStats(status, nlp, solution=x, objective=obj(nlp, x))
end
```

Now run again

```julia:ex16
output = newton(nlp)

println(output)
```

That's already better. Now we can access the solution with

```julia:ex17
output.solution
```

## Improving the solver

Although we have an implementation of our method, it has a few shortcomings, which we must address before continuing.
Mainly, our solver needs a better handling of the stopping conditions.
Currently, we only stop when the first order condition $\|\nabla f(x_k)\| < \epsilon$ is satisfied.
Although our method is good, this could fail to happen in a reasonable time, and therefore we have to define some stopping conditions to prevent an infinite loop.

The two main conditions we'll add are the number of iterations and elapsed time to be limited.
In this case, the result of the solver run may no be a `:first_order` situation anymore, which means that we need to use other `status` value.
Here's the list:

```julia:ex18
SolverCore.show_statuses()
```

We can see that `max_iter` and `max_time` are the most adequates for our case.

In addition, the maximum amount of time and iterations that the solver can execute are usually arguments passed to the solver.
Since the only mandatory argument must be the model, we can use optional arguments.
We prefer to use keywords.

Change your code considering the changes below:

```julia:ex19
function newton(
  nlp :: AbstractNLPModel; # Only mandatory argument, notice the ;
  max_time :: Float64 = 30.0, # maximum allowed time
  max_iter :: Int = 100 # maximum allowed iterations
)
  # …
  x = copy(nlp.meta.x0) # starting point # hide
  α = 1e-2 # Armijo parameter # hide
  ρ = 0.0 # hide
  iter = 0
  t₀ = time()
  Δt = time() - t₀
  status = :unknown
  tired = Δt ≥ max_time > 0 || iter ≥ max_iter > 0
  solved = norm(grad(nlp, x)) ≤ 1e-6
  while !(solved || tired)
    # …
    B = Symmetric(hess(nlp, x), :L) # hide
    factor = cholesky(B + ρ * I, check=false) # hide
    while !issuccess(factor) # hide
      ρ = max(1e-8, 10ρ) # hide
      factor = cholesky(B + ρ * I, check=false) # hide
    end # hide
    d = factor \ -grad(nlp, x) # hide
    t = 1.0 # hide
    fx = obj(nlp, x) # hide
    ft = obj(nlp, x + t * d) # hide
    slope = dot(grad(nlp, x), d) # hide
    while !(ft ≤ fx + α * t * slope) # hide
      t *= 0.5 # hide
      ft = obj(nlp, x + t * d) # hide
    end # hide
    x += t * d # hide
    iter += 1
    Δt = time() - t₀
    tired = Δt ≥ max_time > 0 || iter ≥ max_iter > 0
    solved = norm(grad(nlp, x)) ≤ 1e-6
  end
  if solved
    status = :first_order
  elseif tired
    if Δt ≥ max_time > 0
      status = :max_time
    elseif iter ≥ max_iter > 0
      status = :max_iter
    end
  end

  return GenericExecutionStats(status, nlp, solution=x, objective=obj(nlp, x), iter=iter, elapsed_time=Δt)
end
```

Many of the lines are self-explanatory, so let's focus on the complex ones.
```
tired = Δt ≥ max_time > 0 || iter ≥ max_iter > 0
solved = norm(grad(nlp, x)) ≤ 1e-6
while !(solved || tired)
```
Both `tired` and `solved` are Boolean indicators, that is, they are true to indicate that a certain situation has happened.

The variable `tired` is true if the elapsed time surpass the maximum time or if the number of iterations surpass the maximum of iterations.
We also allow for the case of "turning off" the check by setting the corresponding maximum to 0 or a negative number.

The variable `solved` is true if the the point satisfies the first order condition.

  The conditional at the end verifies these conditions and set the appropriate `status`.
  Notice that we set the `status` to `:unknown` at the beginning, both for the good practice of having a default value, but also because if the code returns the `:unknown` status, we **really** don't know what happened.

## Benchmarking

With a solver in hands, we can start to do more advanced things, such as benchmarking and comparing our `newton` method to other solvers.

Since we only implemented one solved, we'll use `lbfgs` from the package JSOSolvers to compare against.

```julia:ex20
using JSOSolvers

output = lbfgs(nlp)
print(output)
```

And to compare both solvers, we need a collection of problems.
Let's just create one manually for now.

```julia:ex21
problems = [
  ADNLPModel(x -> x[1]^2 + 4 * x[2]^2, ones(2)),
  ADNLPModel(x -> (1 - x[1])^2 + 100 * (x[2] - x[1]^2)^2, [-1.2; 1.0]),
  ADNLPModel(x -> x[1]^2 + x[2] - 11 + (x[1] + x[2]^2 - 7)^2, [-1.0; 1.0]),
  ADNLPModel(x -> log(exp(-x[1] - 2x[2]) + exp(x[1] + 2) + exp(2x[2] - 1)), zeros(2))
];
```

And now, we use `bmark_solvers` from the package SolverBenchmark to automatically run both solvers on all these problems.

```julia:ex22
using SolverBenchmark

solvers = Dict(:newton => newton, :lbfgs => lbfgs)
stats = bmark_solvers(solvers, problems)
```

The results is a Dictionary of Symbols to DataFrame tables.

```julia:ex23
@show typeof(stats)
@show keys(stats)
```

Using SolverBenchmark, it's easy to create a markdown table from the results.

```julia:ex24
cols = [:name, :status, :objective, :elapsed_time, :iter]
pretty_stats(stats[:newton][!, cols])
```

We can also create a similar table in .tex format, using something like

```julia:ex25
open("newton.tex", "w") do io
  pretty_latex_stats(io, stats[:newton][!, cols])
end
rm("newton.tex") # hide
```

That will give us a nicely formatted table that we can just plug into our
latex code.

## Performance profiles

Lastly, for comparison of the methods, it is costumary to show a Performance Profile.[^2]
Internally we use the package BenchmarkProfiles, though using `performance_profile` from SolverBenchmark will actually work directly with the output of `bmark_solvers`.

```julia:ex26
using Plots
performance_profile(stats, df -> df.elapsed_time)
png(joinpath(@OUTPUT, "perfprof")) # hide
```

\figalt{Performance profile}{perfprof.png}

Notice how the profile indicate that all problems were solved by `newton`, although it is clearly not the case. That happens because our cost function for the performance profile was only the elapsed time. A better approach would be something like.

```julia:ex27
cost(df) = (df.status .!= :first_order) * Inf + df.elapsed_time
performance_profile(stats, cost)
png(joinpath(@OUTPUT, "perfprof2")) # hide
```

\figalt{Performance profile}{perfprof2.png}

## Improving the solver more

Although we did implement the proposed method, we could improve the code a little bit.
The following function is an improvement of the code in a few points:
  - Reuse `obj(nlp, x)` and `grad(nlp, x)` when possible.
  - Stopping tolerances `atol` and `rtol` are used for a stopping criteria $$ \|\nabla f(x_k)\| \leq \epsilon_{\text{absolute}} + \epsilon_{\text{relative}}\| \nabla f(x_0)\| $$
  - After computing the direction, we reduce `ρ` to try to speed up the method.

```julia:ex28
function newton2(
  nlp :: AbstractNLPModel; # Only mandatory argument
  x :: AbstractVector = copy(nlp.meta.x0), # optimal starting point
  atol :: Real = 1e-6, # absolute tolerance
  rtol :: Real = 1e-6, # relative tolerance
  max_time :: Float64 = 30.0, # maximum allowed time
  max_iter :: Int = 100 # maximum allowed iterations
)

  # Initialization
  fx = obj(nlp, x)
  ∇fx = grad(nlp, x)

  iter = 0
  Δt = 0.0
  t₀ = time()
  α = 1e-2
  ρ = 0.0
  status = :unknown
  ϵ = atol + rtol * norm(∇fx)

  tired = Δt ≥ max_time > 0 || iter ≥ max_iter > 0
  optimal = norm(∇fx) < ϵ

  while !(optimal || tired) # while not optimal or tired

    B = Symmetric(hess(nlp, x), :L)
    factor = cholesky(B + ρ * I, check=false)
    while !issuccess(factor)
      ρ = max(1e-8, 10ρ)
      factor = cholesky(B + ρ * I, check=false)
    end
    d = factor \ -grad(nlp, x)
    ρ = ρ / 10

    t = 1.0
    ft = obj(nlp, x + t * d)
    slope = dot(grad(nlp, x), d)
    while !(ft ≤ fx + α * t * slope)
      t *= 0.5
      ft = obj(nlp, x + t * d)
    end
    t

    x += t * d

    fx = obj(nlp, x)
    ∇fx = grad(nlp, x)

    iter += 1
    Δt = time() - t₀
    tired = Δt ≥ max_time > 0 || iter ≥ max_iter > 0
    ϵ = atol + rtol * norm(∇fx)
    optimal = norm(∇fx) < ϵ
  end

  if optimal
    status = :first_order
  elseif tired
    if iter ≥ max_iter > 0
      status = :max_iter
    elseif Δt ≥ max_time > 0
      status = :max_time
    end
  end

  return GenericExecutionStats(status, nlp, solution=x, objective=fx, dual_feas=norm(∇fx), iter=iter, elapsed_time=Δt)

end
```

And now testing again.

```julia:ex29
solvers = Dict(:newton => newton2, :lbfgs => lbfgs)
stats = bmark_solvers(solvers, problems)
cost(df) = (df.status .!= :first_order) * Inf + df.elapsed_time
performance_profile(stats, cost)
png(joinpath(@OUTPUT, "perfprof3")) # hide
```

\figalt{Performance profile}{perfprof3.png}
