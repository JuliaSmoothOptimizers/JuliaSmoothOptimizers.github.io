# Ecosystems

Our packages can be divided into three non-exclusive ecosystems:
- [Linear Algebra](/ecosystems/linear-algebra/): Packages for dealing with matrices and matrix-like objects. For instance, for solving linear systems, or linear least-squares problems.
- [Models](/ecosystem/models/): Packages that define and access optimization models.
- [Solvers](/ecosystem/solvers/): Packages related to our solvers and the development of other solvers.
