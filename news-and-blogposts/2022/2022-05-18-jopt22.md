# Conference: JuliaSmoothOptimizers at Optimization Days Montréal

We organized a steam of sessions on ’’Numerical optimization and linear algebra with Julia’’ at [Optimization Days/Journées de l’optimisation 2022](https://symposia.gerad.ca/jopt2022/en/home) held at HEC Montréal, May 16-18, 2022. The conference, renowned for its optimization expertise and wine & cheese party, was held in-person for the first time since 2019! The stream featured 16 talks including 6 on JSO-related research. The program of the conference is available [here](https://symposia.gerad.ca/jopt2022/en/schedule), and the Julia sessions: 
- [TB5 - Numerical optimization and linear algebra with Julia I](https://symposia.gerad.ca/jopt2022/en/schedule?slot_id=1882)
- [WA5 - Numerical optimization and linear algebra with Julia II](https://symposia.gerad.ca/jopt2022/en/schedule?slot_id=1881)
- [WB5 - Numerical optimization and linear algebra with Julia III](https://symposia.gerad.ca/jopt2022/en/schedule?slot_id=1880)
- [WC5 - Numerical optimization and linear algebra with Julia IV](https://symposia.gerad.ca/jopt2022/en/schedule?slot_id=1879)
