# Optimization Days 2023 at HEC Montréal: Numerical Optimization and Linear Algebra with Julia

We are thrilled to share that, for the second consecutive year, we organized "Numerical Optimization and Linear Algebra with Julia" sessions during the Optimization Days conference held at HEC Montréal from May 29th to 31st, 2023.
These sessions provided insights into the application of the Julia programming language for numerical optimization and linear algebra tasks, with a focus on the JuliaSmoothOptimizers organization.

The "Numerical Optimization and Linear Algebra with Julia" stream included two sessions, each featuring talks exploring different aspects of optimization and linear algebra using Julia.
Attendees had the opportunity to learn about the benefits of utilizing Julia for optimization, including its speed, user-friendly interface, and powerful mathematical libraries.

There were two sessions with a total of 7 talks:
- [Numerical optimization and linear algebra with Julia I](https://symposia.cirrelt.ca/CORS-JOPT/en/schedule?slot_id=2083)
- [Numerical optimization and linear algebra with Julia II](https://symposia.cirrelt.ca/CORS-JOPT/en/schedule?slot_id=2102)

During these sessions, participants had the chance to connect with fellow enthusiasts and experts in the field.
Additionally, JSO stickers were distributed, adding a touch of excitement to the event.
We extend our sincere appreciation to the speakers and attendees for their valuable contributions to the success of these sessions.
