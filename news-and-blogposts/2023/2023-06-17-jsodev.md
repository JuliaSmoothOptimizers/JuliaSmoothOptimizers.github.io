# JuliaSmoothOptimizers.github.io is now JSO.dev!

We are thrilled to announce a significant milestone in the journey of JuliaSmoothOptimizers (JSO) - a rebranding that brings with it a new domain and a fresh identity.
We are excited to share that our organization has transitioned from juliasmoothoptimizers.github.io to the snappy and developer-focused jso.dev!
This change not only aligns perfectly with our organization's goals but also enhances our branding and community engagement.
In this blog post, we delve into the reasons behind this change, the process of execution, and the bright future that lies ahead.

## The Drive Behind Rebranding

Branding is more than just a name; it is a reflection of an organization's essence and aspirations. JuliaSmoothOptimizers, often affectionately known as JSO, has a vibrant and thriving community of Julia developers dedicated to optimizing and enhancing the language's capabilities. The decision to rebrand to jso.dev was driven by several key factors.

Simplicity and Memorability: We recognized that having a shorter and more memorable domain name would strengthen our brand recognition. jso.dev is concise, making it easier for our community to access our resources and stay connected.
Developer Focus: The .dev domain suffix is synonymous with developers and technical content. It perfectly encapsulates our identity as an organization of passionate Julia developers, committed to pushing the boundaries of optimization.
Alignment with JSO: Our community fondly refers to us as JSO. The transition to jso.dev naturally aligns with this nickname, further solidifying our brand's coherence and recognition.

## Looking Ahead

As we embark on this exciting new phase, the JSO team is more determined than ever to continue fostering a collaborative environment for Julia developers worldwide. We have exciting plans for the future, including more user-friendly documentation, engaging tutorials, and cutting-edge optimization tools. Your support and feedback drive us forward, and we are incredibly grateful for the vibrant community that has made this journey possible.

## Conclusion

We are thrilled to have you with us on this momentous occasion as we proudly unveil our new web address, jso.dev. This rebranding represents a significant step forward for JuliaSmoothOptimizers, and we are excited to embrace the opportunities it presents. As always, we welcome your thoughts and suggestions as we continue to refine and improve our organization. Thank you for being a part of our journey, and here's to a bright and promising future for JSO and the Julia community!
