# Julia Smooth Optimizers is a community partner of the JuliaCon Local Eindhoven 2023

The [JuliaCon Local Eindhoven 2023](https://juliacon.org/local/eindhoven2023/) happens on 01/December/2023, and JSO is happy to be part of their community partners.
We will be present at the event, so feel free to search for us there.

This is the first JuliaCon Local event.
It will be a full day of talks, co-located with PyData Eindhoven 2023 (one day earlier).

The proposals are still open, as well as the early bird tickets.

See you there!
