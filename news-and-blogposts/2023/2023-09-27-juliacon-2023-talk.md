# Julia Smooth Optimizers @ JuliaCon 2023 talk is up on GitHub

In this talk, [Tangi Migot](https://tmigot.github.io) gave an overview of the recent progress regarding the continuous nonlinear nonconvex optimization solves implemented in the JuliaSmoothOptimizers (JSO) organization.
He introduced the new package [JSOSuite](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/JSOSuite.jl) that provides a more user-friendly interface between the users and our solvers.

You can check the full talk at the [JuliaCon 2023 youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x52QlIb8E9Y).
