## Exploring Nonlinear Optimization with JuliaSmoothOptimizers at JuliaCon Local Eindhoven 2023

We are excited to share that one of the core members of the JuliaSmoothOptimizers organization, [Abel Siqueira](https://abelsiqueira.com/), recently delivered a compelling talk at the [JuliaCon Local Eindhoven 2023](https://juliacon.org/local/eindhoven2023/) conference in the Netherlands. The conference, co-located with PyData Eindhoven 2023, provided an excellent platform for discussions and presentations on the latest developments in Julia and related technologies.
As published before here, Julia Smooth Optimizers was a community partner of the event.

Abel Siqueira's talk, titled [*Nonlinear Optimization with the Julia Smooth Optimizers Packages*](https://eindhoven2023.pydata.org/juliacon/talk/MYXETU/), delved into the rich ecosystem built by the JSO since its inception in 2015. With over 50 registered packages covering a wide range of nonlinear optimization and linear algebra topics, JSO has been a driving force in providing researchers with the necessary tools to seamlessly transition from prototyping to publication-ready code.

With an extensive package ecosystem and the introduction of JSOSuite, the organization continues to play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between research and practical, user-friendly solutions. As we look forward to the future, events like JuliaCon Local Eindhoven contribute significantly to the collaborative and innovative spirit of the Julia community.

Abstract:
*The talk highlighted JSO's primary objective: to empower researchers by offering high-level, well-maintained optimization packages. The organization is committed to facilitating a smooth journey from the conceptualization of ideas to the development of user-friendly optimization packages. A significant stride in this direction is the introduction of JSOSuite, a comprehensive package aiming to be a one-stop solution for nonlinear optimization in Julia.*
