# Krylov.jl: Elevating JuliaSmoothOptimizers to New Heights!

Excitement is buzzing within the JuliaSmoothOptimizers community as we proudly announce a significant achievementâ€”the publication of the [Krylov.jl paper in the Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05187).
[Krylov.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/Krylov.jl) is not just a package; it's a success story that showcases the growing impact of our community in the world of computational mathematics.

[Krylov.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/Krylov.jl) is a powerhouse of carefully selected Krylov methods designed to tackle a diverse range of linear problems.
Initiated by Alexis Montoison and Dominique Orban, Krylov.jl is more than a successâ€”it's a testament to the collaborative spirit of our community.
This work was part of Alexis' PhD work that he successfully defended this Winter âœ¨.
